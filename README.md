## Getting Started
This site is based on revel, a web framework for the go language.  Deployment and setup operations are partially automated using rake (i.e. ruby make).  Go and rake are prerequisites for deploying the site.

### Rake commands:

    rake install: Installs dependencies and compiles tool for initializing human ppi predictions database. 

    rake launch_server[procs]: Sets the environmental variable which dictates how many system threads Go can utilize (procs) and launches the app. 
    
### Deployment Setup
Ubuntu comes with a service called Upstart, which isused for automatically starting services on system startup.  The configuration file for this web app is located on the host at: /etc/init/go-pcg-http.conf


The app uses Apache as a reverse proxy for handling requests.
